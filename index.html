    <p>Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born.
        Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date. The following is one of
        the many methods that exist for that;</p>
        <p> The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.Here is an example of the system</p>

            table, th, td {
                border: 1px solid black;

            </style>
        <table>
            <tr>
